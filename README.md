## Summary of BCG Data Science and Analytics Virtual Internship - Forage

This internship simulates a data science project at BCG focusing on customer churn in the energy sector.

**Client:** PowerCo, a gas and electricity utility facing churn (customer loss) in the SME (Small & Medium Enterprise) segment after energy market deregulation.

**Problem:**  Identify if price sensitivity is a major driver of churn and build a model to predict churn risk.

**Tasks:**

1. **Formulating the Hypothesis:**
    *  Define price sensitivity as a metric.
    *  Outline steps to test the correlation between price sensitivity and churn using historical customer and pricing data with a churn indicator.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Analyze data types, statistics, and variable distributions to understand the dataset (1 hour).
    * Calculate price sensitivity and assess its correlation with churn (30 minutes).
    * Summarize key findings and suggest additional data sources for improvement (10-15 minutes).

3. **Feature Engineering & Modeling:**
    * Analyze existing features and explore creating new ones that might improve churn prediction. (e.g., difference in off-peak prices between December and January)
    * Build a Random Forest classification model to predict churn based on engineered features.
    * Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics and explain its strengths and weaknesses (1-1.5 hours).
    * (Bonus) Estimate potential cost savings for PowerCo based on the model's ability to identify churn risk and optimize discount targeting.

**Deliverables:**

* Code/script or PDF document of your EDA analysis.
* Half-page summary or slide with key findings and data augmentation suggestions.
* Jupyter notebook or script documenting feature engineering, model building, evaluation results, and discussion of Random Forest's advantages/disadvantages.
